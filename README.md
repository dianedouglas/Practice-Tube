# _Practice Tube_

#### _A JavaScript App For Practicing Your Musical Instrument with YouTube_

#### By Diane Douglas

## Description

#### [Practice Tube](dianedouglas.github.io/Practice-Tube)

This app allows you to loop parts of YouTube videos at half speed to make it easier to learn your favorite songs on your instrument. 

* Search for a video in the search bar such as "The Trooper by Iron Maiden".
* Click on a video under "Results".
* When the song gets to the beginning of your favorite riff, click "Start Loop". 
* When the song gets to the end of the part you want to practice, click "End Loop" and it will begin to loop.
* Click "Half Speed" to slow it down. 
* To resume normal playback, unclick the "Looping" button.
* To resume normal speed, unclick the "Half Speed" button. 
* For convenience, if you just want to hear the last ten or thirty seconds of the song again, click either of the "Rewind :10" or "Rewind :30" buttons.
